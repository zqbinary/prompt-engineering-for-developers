    "# 第三章 迭代优化\n",
    "\n",
    "在开发大语言模型应用时，很难通过第一次尝试就得到完美适用的 Prompt。但关键是要有一个**良好的迭代优化过程**，以不断改进 Prompt。相比训练机器学习模型，Prompt 的一次成功率可能更高，但仍需要通过多次迭代找到最适合应用的形式。\n",
    "\n",
    "本章以产品说明书生成营销文案为例，展示 Prompt 迭代优化的思路。这与吴恩达在机器学习课程中演示的机器学习模型开发流程相似：有了想法后，编写代码、获取数据、训练模型、查看结果。通过分析错误找出适用领域，调整方案后再次训练。Prompt 开发也采用类似循环迭代的方式，逐步逼近最优。具体来说，有了任务想法后，可以先编写初版 Prompt，注意清晰明确并给模型充足思考时间。运行后检查结果，如果不理想，则分析 Prompt 不够清楚或思考时间不够等原因，做出改进，再次运行。如此循环多次，终将找到适合应用的 Prompt。\n",

    "总之，很难有适用于世间万物的所谓“最佳 Prompt ”，开发高效 Prompt 的关键在于找到一个好的迭代优化过程，而非一开始就要求完美。通过快速试错迭代，可有效确定符合特定应用的最佳 Prompt 形式。\n"

    "\n",
    "具体来说，首先编写初版 Prompt，然后通过多轮调整逐步改进，直到生成了满意的结果。对于更复杂的应用，可以在多个样本上进行迭代训练，评估 Prompt 的平均表现。在应用较为成熟后，才需要采用在多个样本集上评估 Prompt 性能的方式来进行细致优化。因为这需要较高的计算资源。\n",
